if --add-dir then add the artist/album to the .music_sync.conf file

update the syntax function to add --add-dir

encode everything in ogg before pushing it to my phone

make sure the tags used for the albums and artists are correct before pushing to my phone

delete all the playlists in artists and albums

add a dir with all the playlists i created on my computer and on android (if that's possible)

verify file and if exists and same size then don't push it
that implies rewriting of pushDir
