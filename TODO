if --add-dir then add the artist/album to the .music_sync.conf file

encode everything in ogg before pushing it to my phone

make sure the tags used for the albums and artists are correct before pushing to my phone

delete all the playlists in artists and albums

add a dir with all the playlists i created on my computer and on android (if that's possible)
make a funciton to create playlists & store them in .playlists ?

verify file and if exists and same size then don't push it
that implies rewriting of pushDir

If I want to have covers, I should buy the android app, which is a very good app BTW...

Maybe rename files (with musicbrainz picard ?)

Instead or in addition to the notifications, can do a voice that talks about what happened

Launch the function with cron
